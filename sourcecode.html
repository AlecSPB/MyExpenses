<div class="block">
  <h2>Sourcecode</h2>
  <p><span class="application">My Expenses</span> is free software.
    Free like in "free beer", i.e. you can <a class="switch" href="#install">install</a> it without paying.
    But also free like in "free speech", ie. you can download its source
    code from  <a href="https://github.com/mtotschnig/MyExpenses">mtotschnig/MyExpenses</a>, 
    inspect how it works, maybe learn from it, improve it, even redistribute it, provided you
    respect the <a class="switch" href="#licence">licence</a>.
