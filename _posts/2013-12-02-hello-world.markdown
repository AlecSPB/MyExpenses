title: Plans for future and recurrent transactions

excerpt: This post explains how to create plans for future and recurrent transactions with My Expenses

---
Starting with version 1.10, My Expenses allows to create plans for expenses or income that occur in
the future and may be recurrent. These plans are stored in the calendar storage available on your
Android device, and thus can be visualized with your favorite Calendar app, and can make use of standard
Calendar features like reminders. This post is the first one to be published again on this
website, after I had switched from a previous posting mechanism for [older posts](/en/news/news5.html)
to publishing shorter news on My Expenses' [Google Plus](https://plus.google.com/116736113799210525299/) page. I will go through the workflow of setting up a plan, and explain some of its aspects.
