      Through this new channel, I will publish regularly explanations and discussions of
      <span class="application">My Expenses</span>'s functionality. In contrast to the tutorial, which I
      try to keep consistent with the current release, and which is translated to all supported
      languages, these articles are meant to document new features, as they arise, to generate
      comments from users and hence to contribute to the app's continuos improvement.
    </p><p>
      In answer to requests voiced already by its first users, version 1.5.0. of <span class="application">My
      Expenses</span> introduced payment methods. The functionality is equivalent to how
      payment methods work in <span class="application">Grisbi</span>: Payment methods are linked to
      accounts through account types. When you create an account, you define its type as one of CASH,
      BANK, ASSET or LIABILITY. When you create transactions in a given account, you can then make
      use of the payment methods that are linked to its account type. 
    </p><p>
      Through the "Manage payment methods" activity from the preferences screen, you can change, add
      and delete methods.

      <span class="application">My Expenses</span> has four predefined payment methods, all of them by
      default linked only to bank accounts: CHEQUE, CREDITCARD, DEPOSIT, DIRECTDEBIT. Those cannot
      be deleted, or renamed, but you can alter their association with account types. Clicking on a
      method or activating the <span class="guibutton">New</span> button brings you to the following screen:
    </p><div class="figure"><a name="news1_2"></a><div class="figure-contents"><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="news1_2.png"></div></div></div></div><p>
      Here you decide if the method should only be used for expenses (credit), incomes (debit), or
      both (neutral). And you check the account types where you want to make use of it. Now in the
      edit screen for transactions you will see a line labeled <span class="guilabel">Method</span>, with a button opening the
      dialog where you select one of the applicable methods for the transaction.
    </p><div class="figure"><a name="news1_3"></a><div class="figure-contents"><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="news1_3.png"></div></div></div></div><p>
    Unfortunately, payment methods are not yet expressed in the QIF export, because the standard
    does not provide a field for this information. If you have an idea on how to export transactions
    in a more expressive format, let me know.
