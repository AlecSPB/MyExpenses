If you manage
    multiple accounts, you will be able to navigate through them using the Swipe Gesture.
    It also introduces a couple of minor enhancements that have been requested for by users:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>You now can directly edit templates. Previously, you were required to delete a template,
    and create a new one, if you had needed some modification to its title or any other information.
    </p><div class="figure"><a name="news4_1"></a><div class="figure-contents"><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="news4_1.png"></div></div></div></div></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Now you can restore backups from the preferences screen. Previously, backups were automatically
    restored, when one was found during app installation. Thus, you needed to uninstall/reinstall
    <span class="application">My Expenses</span>, in order to restore a backup. The restoration upon install
    is now no longer automatic, but confirmation is asked for.
    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Users that have set up multiple accounts with the same currency, will see a "Total" button in the
    accounts list, which displays the aggregate totals accross all accounts.
    </p><div class="figure"><a name="news4_2"></a><div class="figure-contents"><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="news4_2.png"></div></div></div></div></li></ul></div><p>
      Starting with 1.7.0, there is a new distribution model for <span class="application">My
      Expenses</span>, through which I'd like to sollicit your contribution to the funding of
      the further development, in order to keep it free of advertisment and open source. Selected new features
      are handled as premium features. Those can be used five times for free, and then will be
      restricted to users having installed a paid Contrib app shortly available on Google Play.
      Users participating in the development of the app (e.g. as translators or beta testers), or
      prefering to donate through PayPal or Flattr (which by the way keep a lower percentage of the
      transaction amount to themselves), can request a key that will unlock the premium features
      without installation of the Contrib app. So please give the newest alpha
      version a try, and use the "Request Contrib Key" entry in the preferences screen. I
      will usually answer these requests in less than 24 hours.
