<p><span class="application">My Expenses</span> is free software.
  Free like in "free beer", i.e. you can <a href="install.html">install</a> it without paying.
  But also free like in "free speech", ie. you can download its source
  code from  <a href="https://github.com/mtotschnig/MyExpenses">mtotschnig/MyExpenses</a>, 
  inspect how it works, maybe learn from it, improve it, even redistribute it, provided you
  respect the <a href="licence.html">licence</a>.
