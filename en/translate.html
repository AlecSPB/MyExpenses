<p>Translations are managed at <a href="https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/my-expenses/">Transifex</a>,
which provides a nice editor with very helpful productivity tools. If you want to start a translation into a new language,
or help review or complete one of the existing ones, please register at Transifex.</p>
<p>There are four translatable resources hosted at Transifex:
<dl>
<dt><a href="https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/my-expenses/resource/strings/">Strings</a></dt>
<dd>This resource has all messages appearing in the user interface, from button labels, to informative
  dialogues</dd>
<dt><a href="https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/my-expenses/resource/help/">Help</a></dt>
<dd>On each application screen, <span class="application">My Expenses</span> provides a help dialogue
  explaining the availaible functionality. This resource has the titles for the help dialogues, and
  all help texts.</dd>
<dt><a href="https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/my-expenses/resource/upgrade/">Upgrade</a></dt>
<dd>When a new version introduces some important change or new feature, upon upgrading, users are shown
a short explanation. Since these texts are only relevant at the moment a new version is released, they
are stored in a separate resource to make it clear, that they are not needed for new languages.</dd>

<dt><a href="https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/my-expenses/resource/categories_sample/">Categories_sample</a></dt>
<dd><span class="application">My Expenses</span> allows to import a set of default categories for each
language. For some languages, these were originally taken from Grisbi. For a new language, it is not 
necessarily best to translate the existing English categories, but it might be more interesting to
define custom categories that reflect more accurately the economic reality of a linguistic region.
This resource includes the English categories as a template that could be used to create a category
hierarchy for a new language. But it is also possible to retrieve the categories for English or any
of the other languages in their Grisbi XML format at <a href="https://github.com/mtotschnig/MyExpenses/tree/master/res/raw">Github</a>.</dd>
</dl>
</p>
<p>You do not need to contribute to all of these resources, once Strings are translated, users can
profit from the interface in their language, even if they get the other resources in English.</p>
<p>One additional resource that I would like to be able to offer translated to users is the feature
list on this website, also used at Google Play. Localized versions of the <a href="/#faq">FAQ</a> are nice-to-haves, but not mandatory either.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to collaborating with you on making <span class="application">My Expenses</span> available in your language!</p>
